     ## transformString
This transformation is designed to manipulate strings based on their length, and here how it's works

1. If the length of the input string is divisible by 15, it reverses the string and replaces each character with its corresponding ASCII code.
2. If the length is divisible by 3, it simply reverses the entire string.
3. If the length is divisible by 5, it replaces each character with its ASCII code.
4. If none of the above conditions apply, the function returns the original string.
